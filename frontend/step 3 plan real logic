1️⃣ Real-world Free Fire Tournament Flow

Tournament Listing Page

User dekh sakta hai saare tournaments: title, prize, entry fee, start time, max players, status.

Status: Upcoming / Ongoing / Completed

Join Tournament / Registration

Agar tournament free hai → User directly join kar sakta hai

Agar tournament paid hai → User ko payment karna padega

Payment ke baad entry confirm hoti hai

Payment Page

Entry fee show hota hai

Payment gateways use hote hain (Google Pay, Paytm, Stripe, Razorpay, etc.)

Payment successful → backend me Entry record create hoti hai, wallet balance update hota hai

Tournament Detail Page / My Matches

User dekh sakta hai:

Registered players / teams

Scheduled matches

Match result / leaderboard (after matches complete)

2️⃣ Conceptual Flow for Your Web App

Tournament Page

Already tumhare paas hai: list of tournaments + join button

Join Tournament → Payment Page

Jab user “Join” click kare:

Check karo entryFee

If > 0 → redirect to PaymentPage

If 0 → direct join, show “Successfully joined”

Payment Page

Show: tournament details + entry fee

Payment button → deduct from wallet (tumhara wallet API use karke)

Payment successful → Entry record create ho → redirect to MyMatchesPage

My Matches Page / Tournament Detail

Show: matches, opponents, match schedule

Agar tournament ongoing → upcoming matches show

Agar completed → results + leaderboard show

3️⃣ Backend Requirements

Join Tournament API

Already hai

Update: check if entryFee > 0 → wait for payment

Payment success → mark entry as confirmed

Payment API

Endpoint: /api/wallet/pay

Body: { tournamentId, userId, amount }

Logic:

Check wallet balance

Deduct amount

Confirm tournament entry

My Matches API

Endpoint: /api/matches/my

Returns: tournamentId, match schedule, opponents, result (if available)

4️⃣ Frontend Pages Needed

TournamentPage.jsx → List all tournaments + join button

PaymentPage.jsx → Payment + confirm join

MyMatchesPage.jsx → Show matches for user

💡 UX Tip:

Join button → Payment modal / page

Payment success → Toast / alert + redirect to MyMatches

Wallet deduction + tournament entry should be atomic (either both succeed or fail)

Agar chaho to mai abhi PaymentPage.jsx + API logic + redirect after join ka complete working code tumhare frontend-backend ke saath bana du, jise tum direct copy-paste kar sako.
